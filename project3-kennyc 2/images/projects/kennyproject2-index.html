    <h4>MODERNITY</h4>
    <p>Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909
      by the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.
      Marinetti launched the movement in his Manifesto of Futurism,
      which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in
      La gazzetta dell'Emilia, an article then reproduced in the French
      daily newspaper Le Figaro.</p>

      <h3>"SIMULTANEOUS VISION"<h3>
        <p>Umberto Boccioni was one of the most influentional
        Italian painters of all time. His works span across many many years. He helped shape the revolutionary aesthetic of the Futurism movement as one of its principal figures. Despite his short life, his approach to the dynamism of form and the deconstruction of solid mass guided artists long after his death. His works are held by many public art museums, and in 1988 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City organized a major retrospective of 100 pieces</p>

    <h3>"FACES OF FUTURISM"<h3>
      <p>The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of Divisionism, breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been adopted from Divisionism by Giovanni Segantini and others. Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art. Severini was the first to come into contact with Cubism and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists.</p>
