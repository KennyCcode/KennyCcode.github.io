    <p>The City of New York, usually referred to as either New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States.
      With an estimated 2018 population of
      8,398,748 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in
      the United States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest
      metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[11] and one of the world's most populous megacities,[12][13] with an estimated 19,979,477 people
      in its 2018 Metropolitan Statistical Area and 22,679,948 residents in its Combined Statistical Area.

      A global power city,[14] New York City has been described as the cultural,[15][16][17][18][19] financial,[20][21] and media capital of the world,[22][23]
      and exerts a significant impact upon commerce,[21] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. The city's
      fast pace[24][25][26] has inspired the term New York minute.[27] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[28] New York is an important center for
      international diplomacy.
    <br><hr>
    New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.
    The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the
    Duke of York. New York was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[47] and has been the largest US city since 1790.[48] The Statue of Liberty greeted
    millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[49] and is an international symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty
    and peace.In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship,[51] social tolerance, and environmental sustainability,
    and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[55] In 2019,
    New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.[15]

   <h2 id="times">Times Square</h2>
   <p>Times Square is a major commercial intersection, tourist destination, entertainment center and neighborhood in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City
     at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. It stretches from West 42nd to West 47th Streets.[1] Brightly adorned with billboards and advertisements, Times Square
     is sometimes referred to as "The Crossroads of the World",[2] "The Center of the Universe",[3] "the heart of The Great White Way",[4][5][6] and "the heart of the world"
    One of the world's busiest pedestrian areas, it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District[9] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[10]
    Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually.[11] Approximately 330,000 people pass through
    Times Square daily,[12] many of them tourists, while over 460,000 pedestrians walk through Times Square on its busiest days.[7]</p>

    <h2 id="GrandCentral">Grand Central Station </h2>
    <p>The station was first proposed in March 1913 as part of the Dual Contracts.[42] As originally proposed, it ran diagonally under the former Children's Hospital
      on the north side of 42nd Street east of Park Avenue. The route would connect the original subway under Park Avenue, on the west, to the new line under Lexington
      Avenue, on the east, at a point between 43rd and 44th Streets. In April 1913 the plan was modified to run diagonally between Park Avenue just south of 42nd Street to
      Lexington Avenue near 43rd Street.[65] The new alignment also ran under the Grand Union Hotel at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Park Avenue.[66]
      The Public Service Commission voted on the modification in June 1913. A modified route that instead made an S-curve under 40th Street was adopted that November.</p>
